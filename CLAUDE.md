# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start dev server (http://localhost:5173)
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npm run lint         # Run ESLint

# Database setup (one-time, in Supabase dashboard)
# 1. Run supabase/schema.sql in SQL Editor
# 2. Follow supabase/storage-setup.md for storage buckets
```

## Environment Variables (CRITICAL)

The app **requires** Supabase and Stripe configuration to work. Create `.env` from `.env.example`:

```env
# Supabase
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# Stripe (for real payments)
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_51...your-key
```

**Deployment to Vercel**: Set these as environment variables in Vercel dashboard under Settings → Environment Variables.

**Supabase Secrets** (for Edge Functions): Add via Supabase CLI or Dashboard → Settings → Edge Functions:
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_51...your-secret-key`
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=AC...` (for SMS notifications)
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=...` (for SMS notifications)
- `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890` (for SMS notifications)
- `APP_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app` (for SMS links)

**OAuth Setup**: For Google sign-in, configure redirect URLs in:
- **Supabase**: Authentication → URL Configuration → Add production URL
- **Google Cloud Console**: Add `https://your-project.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

## Architecture Overview

### Two-Context System

The app uses a dual-context architecture in [src/App.jsx](src/App.jsx):

1. **AuthContext** ([src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx](src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx))
   - Handles user authentication (email/password, Google OAuth)
   - Manages user sessions and profiles
   - Provides `useAuth()` hook

2. **PhotographerContext** ([src/contexts/PhotographerContext.jsx](src/contexts/PhotographerContext.jsx))
   - Manages photographer-specific state and operations
   - Handles photo uploads with EXIF extraction
   - Generates 6-digit codes for photos
   - Auto-verification after 3 photo uploads
   - Provides `usePhotographer()` hook

Both contexts wrap the entire app and work independently.

### Core Routes

- `/` - Landing page (Hero, HowItWorks, EmotionalStory, ForWho, CTA)
- `/dashboard` - Photographer dashboard (protected route)
- `/photo/:code` - Photo view page (6-digit code lookup)

### Database Architecture

**Key Tables** (see [supabase/schema.sql](supabase/schema.sql)):

1. **profiles** - User profiles (1:1 with auth.users)
2. **photographer_profiles** - Photographer data with verification status
   - `verified` - Auto-set to true after 3 photo uploads
   - `status` - 'pending' | 'active' | 'suspended'
3. **photos** - Photo metadata, EXIF data, storage paths
4. **photo_codes** - 6-digit codes linking to photos
   - `code` - Unique 6-char code (e.g., "ABC123")
   - `customer_email` - Email address for notifications (active)
   - `email_collected_at` - When email was collected
   - `email_sent` - Whether email notification was sent
   - `customer_phone` - Phone number (deprecated, kept for backward compatibility)
   - `is_purchased` - Payment status
   - `purchased_by` - User who bought the photo
5. **transactions** - Payment records

**Storage Buckets** (see [supabase/storage-setup.md](supabase/storage-setup.md)):

- `photos` - **Public** bucket for watermarked images
- `photos-original` - **Private** bucket for full-quality originals (RLS-protected, only accessible after purchase)

### 6-Digit Code System with Email Notifications

The core workflow revolves around unique 6-digit codes with on-site email collection:

1. **On-site**: Photographer generates QR code → Customer scans QR → Customer enters email address
2. **Later**: Photographer uploads photos → System sends email to customer with link
3. **Customer**: Receives email → Clicks link → Views photos → Purchases if desired

**Email Collection Flow** ([src/pages/PhotoView.jsx](src/pages/PhotoView.jsx)):
- When customer visits QR code link, modal prompts for email address
- Email saved to `photo_codes.customer_email`
- Modal can be skipped (email is optional)

**Email Notification Flow** ([supabase/functions/send-email-notification](supabase/functions/send-email-notification/index.ts)):
- Triggered automatically when photos are uploaded
- Only sends if `customer_email` exists and `email_sent` is false
- Uses Supabase's built-in SMTP or configured email service
- Message includes direct link to photo page with beautiful HTML template

**Note**: Phone/SMS functionality is deprecated but still present in database schema for backward compatibility

Code generation in [src/contexts/PhotographerContext.jsx](src/contexts/PhotographerContext.jsx):
- Uses charset: `ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789` (no ambiguous chars)
- Database constraint ensures uniqueness
- Codes are immutable and tied to photos permanently

### Payment System (Stripe Integration)

**Location**: [src/pages/PhotoView.jsx](src/pages/PhotoView.jsx)

The app supports both mock and real Stripe payments:

**Mock Mode** (`MOCK_PAYMENT = true`):
- Simulates 2-second payment delay
- Creates transaction records in database
- Grants access to `photos-original` bucket
- No Stripe setup required - useful for testing flow

**Stripe Mode** (`MOCK_PAYMENT = false`):
- Real payment processing via Stripe
- Payment modal with Stripe Elements UI
- Secure payment via Supabase Edge Function
- Test mode available with test cards

**Setup**: See [STRIPE_SETUP.md](STRIPE_SETUP.md) for complete integration guide.

**Edge Function**: [supabase/functions/create-payment-intent/index.ts](supabase/functions/create-payment-intent/index.ts)
- Creates Stripe Payment Intent
- Requires `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in Supabase secrets
- Frontend uses `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` from `.env`

**Supported Payment Methods**:
- **Card** (Visa, Mastercard, Amex) - Available on all browsers
- **Apple Pay** - Safari + Apple devices only
- **Google Pay** - Chrome with Google Pay setup
- **PayPal** - All browsers (redirects to PayPal.com)

Payment method availability depends on browser, device, and user setup.

### Auto-Verification Logic

**Trigger**: Uploading 3rd photo automatically verifies photographer

**Implementation**: PostgreSQL trigger in [supabase/schema.sql](supabase/schema.sql)
- Function `check_and_verify_photographer()` runs after photo insert
- Sets `verified = true` and `auto_verified_at` timestamp
- Updates `verification_photos_count`

**Frontend**: [src/contexts/PhotographerContext.jsx](src/contexts/PhotographerContext.jsx) refreshes photographer profile after each upload.

## Key Components

### Photo Upload Flow

1. **PhotoUpload** component ([src/components/PhotoUpload.jsx](src/components/PhotoUpload.jsx))
   - Drag & drop interface
   - EXIF extraction using `exifr` library
   - Uploads to both `photos` (watermarked) and `photos-original` buckets
   - Creates photo record + generates unique code

2. **Code Display**
   - Shows 6-digit code with QR code
   - Photographer shares with subject

### Photo Lookup & Purchase Flow

1. User enters code in Hero or CTA components
2. Navigate to `/photo/:code`
3. **PhotoView** page ([src/pages/PhotoView.jsx](src/pages/PhotoView.jsx)):
   - Fetches photo by code
   - Shows watermarked preview (always accessible)
   - Checks if user is admin (via `profiles.is_admin` field)
   - "Unlock Full Quality" button triggers test payment (admin) or real payment (regular user)
   - Downloads original after successful purchase

### Admin Mode (Test Payments)

**Purpose**: Allow testing the purchase flow without real Stripe charges.

**Setup**: See [ADMIN_SETUP.md](ADMIN_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

**How it works**:
- Admin users have `is_admin = true` in the `profiles` table
- PhotoView automatically detects admin status on page load
- Admin purchases use simulated payment (2-second delay)
- Regular users use real Stripe payment
- Both modes create identical database records

**UI Indicator**:
- Admin users see a purple badge: "👑 Admin Mode Active"
- Regular users see standard payment flow

**Setting admin status**:
```sql
UPDATE public.profiles SET is_admin = TRUE WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';
```

## Development Patterns

### Supabase Client

Singleton client in [src/lib/supabase.js](src/lib/supabase.js):
```javascript
import { supabase } from '../lib/supabase'
```

Always check `isSupabaseConfigured()` before critical operations.

### Row Level Security (RLS)

All tables use RLS policies:
- Users can only update their own profiles
- Photographers can only upload/delete their own photos
- Photo buyers can access purchased originals via storage policies

When debugging access issues, check RLS policies in Supabase dashboard.

### Protected Routes

Use `<ProtectedRoute>` wrapper ([src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx](src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx)):
```jsx
<Route path="/dashboard" element={
  <ProtectedRoute>
    <PhotographerDashboard />
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

Redirects to home if not authenticated.

## Common Issues

### "supabaseUrl is required" on Vercel

**Cause**: Environment variables not set in Vercel
**Fix**: Add `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in Vercel dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables → Redeploy

### Google OAuth redirects to localhost:3000

**Cause**: Missing production URL in Supabase redirect URLs
**Fix**:
1. Supabase → Authentication → URL Configuration
2. Add Vercel URL to "Redirect URLs"
3. Update "Site URL" to production domain

### Storage upload fails with "new row violates row-level security policy"

**Cause**: User not in `photographer_profiles` table or wrong bucket permissions
**Fix**: Check storage policies in [supabase/storage-setup.md](supabase/storage-setup.md)

### Photo code not found

**Cause**: Code hasn't been generated or database not configured
**Fix**: Ensure `photo_codes` table exists and `generate_photo_code()` trigger is active

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite + React Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 (configured via Vite plugin)
- **Animation**: Framer Motion
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
